# Celox Inpes
A re-creation of [ABAGames'](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/) [Charge Rush](http://abagames.sakura.ne.jp/html5/cr/), using [Luxe Engine](http://luxeengine.com/), for purpose of learning. The original vision aims to create a simple HTML5 game for mobile browsers.

# Versions and branches

The projects have had several iterations since its original creation. Each milestone are remarked on a branch.

* ```harddark```: The first creation of the game. Remarked for not using any graphic images and utilisation of Luxe's features such as ```luxe.structural.Pool``` and ```luxe.Events```. The outcome, however, was highly processing-ineffective and unplayable on mobile browsers.
* ```uglylight```: A re-creation of the entire game from near scratch. Attempted to optimize for mobile, use lighter and pastel shades of colors, and several alternative methods that is more conventional to a generic game engine. The result is an ugly-as-hell game.
* ```redux1```: A return to dark color, procedural drawing method using ```Luxe.draw``` and several other **Luxe**'s unique features, such as collision detection within ```luxe.Component```.
* ```redux2```: The latest iteration. Returned to using pooling. This iteration, ironically, strongly resemble the first version of the game, plus an immense amount of optimizations and fixed bugs in the process.

It has been interesting project, though not necessarily fun and the outcome has been far from desirable. This is likely due to the ```alpha``` status of **Luxe**. The project is currently on hiatus, but is likely to be updated in the future as **Luxe** is continually being developed towards a ```final``` status.
