# Celox Inpes
A simple game made with [Luxe Engine](http://luxeengine.com/), for purpose of learning. Heavily inspired by [ABAGames'](http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~cs8k-cyu/) [Charge Rush](http://abagames.sakura.ne.jp/html5/cr/).

This project does not use any graphical image or textures. All graphics are drawn using the engine's built-in drawer module.

Musical loop and sound effect generated by [HTML5 Drum Machine](http://html5drummachine.com/).
